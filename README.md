# Strandbeest
This was a revamp of a Strandbeest mechanism inspired by Theo Jansen.

## Improvements
This was a project that was funded and created by memebers of T.U.R.T.L.E Robotics club at Texas A&M. The previous iteration of the strandbeest
robot had some problems which we planned to address in this project.
