# Strandbeest
This was a revamp of a Strandbeest mechanism inspired by Theo Jansen. It consists of a system of linkages at specific proportions which together 
generates a smooth walking motion.

## Improvements
This was a project that was funded and created by memebers of T.U.R.T.L.E Robotics club at Texas A&M. The previous iteration of the strandbeest 
robot had some problems which we planned to address in this project. The first improvement was made to the feet. The previous robot had feet 
that were 3D printed and had bike tubing which was not that effective in reducing the slip while it was walking. Furthermore, weights were embedded 
in the feet so that the feet would be parallel to the ground at the start of each step.

Another major improvement made was to replace the plywood linkages with acrylic ones. The underlying issue with the plywood linkages was insufficient
stability and rigidity while in motion. Furthermore, the gears in the robot when made of plywood were found to skip at random times which led us to rethink
the material selection as a whole. We needed a material that was rigid and easily manufacturable in order to improve upon this. Acrylic was choosen
as it could be easily laser cut into the pieces needed. It was bought at home depot and cut into pieces using the MEEN Rapid Prototyping Studio (RPS)
CO2 laser cutter. New ball bearings were also bought as the old ones were rusty and did not rotate smoothly.
